* Insights
** There is 8 possible position inside cell.
** Active positions is odd .. inactive is even and when placing tile must be in active position unless there is no active position..
** When start slide action you must position tile in unactive position ... 
** When do slide you must check only move in slide direction ... you move other tiles in othoganal if they can..?! .. problem!?
** Slided... Tile is slided (changed position ) .. Must finish in regular position...
